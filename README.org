* A minimal git client in Python
An attempt to write a minimal git client written in Python.

** TODO Setup
+ To test the function `test_index_functions()`, we need an empty repository where
  git is initialized `git init`.
+ The files and folders should have the following structure. The files can have any
  text in them.
  #+begin_src shell
.
├── hello.txt
└── test
    ├── this
    │   └── now
    │       └── testthisnow.txt
    └── this.txt

  #+end_src
